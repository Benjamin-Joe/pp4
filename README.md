# Introduction
This is project four with Code Institute's full stack developer course. For this project I needed to build a Full-Stack website. I decided to combine my favorite game type with one of my favorite websites. So I created a Fallout blog/reddit style website. I chose to create this for a few reasons as listed below:  
It allowed me to show my skills as a developer  
I believe it hits all the criteria needed for this project  
It was a challenge to me personally and is also something that I am very passionate about  
It is a website that has the potential to take off and grow as there is no real place for Fallout fans to go and share thought and tips with one another  
The website has many other features that can be added over time, increasing it's UI.  

The client base I am looking at for this website is a fairly small number of users. A few hundred or so users, But these users will be pasionate Fallout fans. My hope is to create a close and caring community with a common interest.  
Because the website is only about Fallout I think that it will prevent toxic/dangerous users from posting harmful content as only true Fallout fans are going to be interested in signing up for an account.
